    heading:
      'June monthly drop, and a big one — plus a same-day hotfix at the bottom. Headline additions: a live aircraft tracking layer powered by adsb.lol, a worldwide ATC sector overlay with around 1,000 FIRs, accurate DX-target local time using real IANA timezones (with a graceful solar-time fallback when offline), and a non-map text-list panel for screen-reader and low-vision users covering DX, satellites, and POTA/SOTA/WWFF/WWBOTA activations. The long-running VOACAP propagation accuracy issue — the "vertical line through China/Russia" that several users reported — is finally fixed at the root: the antimeridian patch in the midpoint code was making adjacent cells disagree by 178° of midLon, replaced now with a proper great-circle midpoint. On the reliability side: SmartSDR PTT/MOX is detected for the first time, the Cloud Relay auth retry storm is contained, the DX Cluster proxy stays connected through quiet bands, and satellite math only runs for the birds you actually have selected. Plus a substantial accessibility push — every tab strip now follows the W3C tablist pattern with arrow-key navigation, spot lists are announced as tables, status changes go through aria-live regions, and there\'s a non-map alternative view of the map data. The same-day v26.4.1 hotfix restored the AMSAT and SatNOGS satellite fallback sources that v26.4.0 inadvertently dropped — see the last item below.',

After multiple cosmetic rounds (alpha taper, 3×3 spatial blur — both kept as defensive smoothing), the actual bug turned out to be in the server's midpoint code: midLon was computed as a longitude average with a sloppy antimeridian patch that, for a DE in the Americas, flipped at exactly lon=106 for every latitude and produced a 178° midLon jump between adjacent cells — which fed wildly different solar zenith and ionospheric inputs into MUF/LUF on either side of an arbitrary geographic line. Replaced with a proper great-circle midpoint (continuous everywhere, short-path automatically). Affects /api/propagation, /api/propagation/heatmap, /api/propagation/mufmap. Separately, the azimuthal projection now subdivides each propagation cell into a 20-vertex polygon so rectangles in lat/lon actually curve correctly on the disc instead of rendering blocky and distorted near the antipode.",

Auth detection was also missing because the DXSpider login prompt has no trailing newline; we now mark the session authenticated on the first spot received. (2) The /api/dxcluster/paths endpoint had one AbortController shared between the proxy fetch and the HamQTH fallback fetch, so when the proxy hung to its timeout the fallback ran with an already-aborted signal and rejected instantly.

The corresponding server warnings are rate-limited to once per 5 minutes per session ID prefix, and the rate-limit map is now pruned on the existing 5-minute cleanup pass so it can\'t grow unbounded. Separately, the SmartSDR plugin now subscribes to "radio all" to receive the interlock state object, which is where the FlexRadio API actually reports live transmit state — so MOX/PTT is detected for the first time and the On Air indicator switches RX → TX when you key up.

Self-hosted installs were unaffected because their home or LAN IPs reach CelesTrak fine. The v26.4.1 hotfix ships a new server-side TLE-to-OMM converter (server/utils/tle-to-omm.js) that lets the OMM resolver consume the AMSAT nasabare.txt bulk feed plus per-NORAD SatNOGS DB lookups, wired in as state-machine fallback stages that activate when CelesTrak times out or is unreachable.
